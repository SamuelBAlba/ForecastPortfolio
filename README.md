# ForecastPortfolio
## Sam's Forecast

ForecastPortfolio is the general name of my directory, However Sam's forecast is the title you'll see on the application

## Motivation

I decided I was bored with how I traditionally check the forecast and wanted something that represents me and my style.

## Code Style

The whole project was coded using vanilla javascript.
